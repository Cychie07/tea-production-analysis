# Tea Production Analysis
Simulated data analysis of black tea production at PT Perkebunan Nusantara I Regional II – Malabar

This project is a simulated data analysis based on my field internship experience at PT Perkebunan Nusantara I Regional II – Malabar. It focuses on the environmental factors that influence the enzymatic oxidation process in black tea production.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (16 January 2025) includes:
- Oxidation time for 4 beds (in minutes)
- Room temperature and humidity
- Internal and external tea powder temperatures
- Tea leaf spreading thickness

Data was collected hourly over a 14-hour shift during enzymatic oxidation monitoring.

## Objective
- Explore trends in oxidation parameters
- Understand how temperature & humidity affect oxidation timing
- Visualize potential inefficiencies or deviations

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- (Optional) Python: pandas, matplotlib

## 📁 Files
- `tea_production_simulated.xlsx`: main data file used in analysis
